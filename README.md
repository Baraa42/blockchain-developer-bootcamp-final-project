## P2P Betting Dapp

### Description 

The project implements a P2P betting contract for any event with 3 outcomes ( ex football game with Home/Win/Draw).

The game contract is deployed by the admin (contract owner), initially the game status is Open and only the owner can change it (this should be changed in the futur and the status should be changed by an oracle like Chainlink)

The order matching algorithm is simplified here and players can only bet one of these stakes :
  - 1 Ether
  - 0.1 Ether
  - 0.01 Ether
  - 0.001 Ether
